			ChangeLog for Graph-ReadWrite

1.02
	Fixed a bug in the XML writer module - the way it was using
	XML::Writer caused STDOUT to be closed after you've written
	a graph. I consider it a bug in XML::Writer, but I was able
	to change the way Graph::Writer::XML uses that module.

	Basically it just means that we construct a new instance
	of XML::Writer every time we write out a graph. For most
	uses, this won't be a problem, but you'd notice a hit if
	you were creating the writer and then writing a lot of graphs.

	This was noticed by Mike Hayward <hayward@loup.net>
