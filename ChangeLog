			ChangeLog for Graph-ReadWrite

1.05	2002-jan-20 neilb

	Added a basic test-suite.

	Commented out debugging output in the HTK Writer. Sorry Phil!

1.04	2001-nov-11 neilb

	Added Graph::Reader::Dot, a reader for the Dot format
	contributed by Mark Hillebrand.

	Fixed a bug in Graph::Reader::XML, found by Mark Hillebrand.
	The reader would only cope with a single <attribute> element
	inside each graph, node or edge element.

	Changed contact email address to neil@bowers.com

1.03

	Added reader and writer classes for HTK lattice files.

1.02
	Fixed a bug in the XML writer module - the way it was using
	XML::Writer caused STDOUT to be closed after you've written
	a graph. I consider it a bug in XML::Writer, but I was able
	to change the way Graph::Writer::XML uses that module.

	Basically it just means that we construct a new instance
	of XML::Writer every time we write out a graph. For most
	uses, this won't be a problem, but you'd notice a hit if
	you were creating the writer and then writing a lot of graphs.

	This was noticed by Mike Hayward <hayward@loup.net>

1.01

	Added support for URL attribute on nodes in Dot.

	Added support for almost all attributes understood by VCG.

	Added a rough cut at a Writer class for daVinci:
		Graph::Writer::daVinci

1.00 feb 2001 neilb

	Initial release - has baseclass for Reader and Writer classes.

	Reader and Writer for simple XML format.

	Writers for Dot and VCG formats.
