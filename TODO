    TODO for Graph-ReadWrite

* add test cases for reading and writing attributes

* consider doing readers and writers for other graph formats:
	- GraphML	graphml.graphdrawing.org
	- GXL		http://www.gupro.de/GXL/
	- GML		http://www.infosun.fmi.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/
	- XGMML		http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~puninj/XGMML/
	- GDL		http://www.aisee.com/gdl/nutshell/
	  (this is possibly exactly the same as the VCG format,
	   as aiSee is the commercial version of VCG))

* readers for formats we currently only have writers for:
	- daVinci
	- VCG
