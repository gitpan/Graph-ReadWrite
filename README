			Graph-ReadWrite
			      1.00

This is a collection of perl classes for reading and writing
directed graphs in a variety of file formats. There are two
base classes:

	Graph::Reader
	Base class for classes which read a graph
	file and create an instance of the Graph class.

	Graph::Writer
	Base class for classes which take an instance of the
	Graph class and write it out in a specific file format.

This distribution also defines a simple XML format for storing
directed graphs, defined to meet the needs of the Graph class.
A reader and writer are provided for this:

	Graph::Reader::XML
	Graph::Writer::XML

Writers are also included for Dot and VCG, two freely available
packages for displaying / rendering graphs.

	Graph::Writer::Dot
	Graph::Writer::VCG

Dependencies:
	Graph		Jarkko's Graph classes
	XML::Parser	if you use Graph::Reader::XML
	XML::Writer	if you use Graph::Writer::XML
	IO::File

Bugs, suggestions, and new readers and writers will be gratefully received.
